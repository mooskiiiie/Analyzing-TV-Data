# Analyzing-TV-Data
<p> In this mini project, I used data manipulation and visualization to explore the dataset of Super Bowl </p>
<p> Here are the questions that were addressed in this mini project: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The difference between the points of teams</li>
  <li>Does blowouts lead to lost of viewers? </li>
  <li>Does ads have a relationship with the rate of viewers?</li>
  <li>Who had the most halftime show appearance?</li>
  <li>Who performed the most songs?</li>
</ul>
